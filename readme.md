# ZWS Browser Extension

This is a very simple and easy to use browser extension to shorten URLs using [Zero Width Shortener](https://zws.im).

You can [install it for Chrome and Opera here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zero-width-shortener/bpfglcjjbafobagnacabgjncefhakjog)
It works for most browsers, but we only publish it on the Chrome Web Store.
